# Price Optimization Platform

This is an intelligent price optimization system designed specifically for Kenyan retail SMEs. It utilizes an **Random Forest** regressor to predict demand elasticity and prescribes optimal price points to maximize revenue while maintaining competitive market positioning.

---

# 🚀 Key Features

* **Predictive Demand Modeling:** Achievement of **0.75²** and **5.90% RMSE** using XGBoost.
* **Automated Competitor Tracking:** Integrates with Shopify-based retail APIs and HTML based scraping to momitor product prices.
* **Scipy Optimization:** Simulates thousands of price scenarios to find the revenue-maximizing point.
* **Admin Dashboard:** Includes Model Explainability (SHAP), performance monitoring (MAE/RMSE), and RBAC management.
* **Streamlit UI:** An intuitive interface for retail managers to manage inventory pricing.

# 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a four-tier decoupled architecture to ensure sub-second inference performance.

# 📊 Model Performance

Our comparative analysis identified **XGBoost** as the best-performing model for Kenyan retail datasets.

| Model | R² | MAPE | MAE |
|------|------|------|------|
| **XGBoost** | **0.93** | **2.66%** | **0.07** |
| Random Forest | 0.85 | 10.71% | 0.19 |
| LSTM | 0.88 | 71.04% | 0.29 |

# 🧩 Key Modules

### **data_ingestion.py**

Handles loading and cleaning of raw sales data from the POS system.

---

### **feature_eng.py**

Performs **feature engineering** by generating additional variables such as:

* lagged sales features  
* price-to-competitor ratios  
* rolling demand averages  
* price volatility indicators  

These engineered features improve the predictive performance of the machine learning model.

---

### **train_model.py**

Trains the machine learning model (**XGBoost regression**) using historical sales and engineered features.

---

### **demand_prediction.py**

Uses the trained model to forecast product demand for candidate price scenarios.

---

### **price_optimizer.py**

Evaluates different price points and determines the **optimal price that maximizes revenue or profit**.

---

### **dashboard.py**

Streamlit dashboard that allows users to:

* select products
* visualize pricing analytics
* view recommended prices
